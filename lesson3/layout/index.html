                        <p>Like the checkbox, a radio is an input component that holds a boolean value. Under the hood,

                            are no different than HTML radio inputs. However, like other Ionic components, radios are
                            styled
                            differently on each platform. Unlike checkboxes, radio components form a group, where only
                            one radio
                            can be selected at a time. </p>

            <p>When it comes to URLs, Ionic 2 works a bit differently than Ionic 1. Instead of using
                URLs to navigate, we use them to make sure we can always come back to a page (on app launch, for
                example). This means we aren’t limited to using href to navigate around. However, we still have the
                option to use a URL to navigate to a page when necessary.</p>
